Narrativai aims to revolutionise the way businesses access, understand, and utilise critical qualitative and quantitative data by leveraging large language models, natural language search, generative AI, and data visualization tools.<!--more--> Our goal is to create a new business operating system that eventually replaces traditional CRMs and BI tools, weaving together the narrative of your business, bridging communication gaps, and making organizations more efficient, agile, and competitive.

## Problem

Traditional CRMs and BI tools struggle to provide real-time, actionable insights, and their complex interfaces require specialised training. They often overlook qualitative data, such as conversation transcripts and industry events, which are crucial for understanding the context behind quantitative data like revenue churn and customer surveys. As businesses scale and develop larger teams across multiple locations, communication silos emerge, increasing the risk of lost information and decreased efficiency.

## Solution

Narrativai offers an AI-powered platform that automates data analysis, reporting, and communication. By integrating large language models, natural language search, generative AI, and data visualization tools, our platform transforms raw qualitative and quantitative data into meaningful narratives and insights, enabling better decision-making and fostering seamless communication across teams and locations.
